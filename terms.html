            <p>Last updated: May 2025</p>

            <p>Welcome to ScottishInsults.com! We're glad you're here. Before you start flinging insults like a true Highlander, there are just a few rules to keep in mind:</p>

            <h2>1. You're Free to Use the Insults</h2>
            <p>All insults on this site are meant to be shared, laughed at, and lovingly hurled (verbally, please) at your mates. You are free to copy, quote, remix, and repost them â€” even on social media, blogs, or tattooed on your arm (seriously, let us know if you do).</p>

            <h2>2. Don't Copy the Code or Data</h2>
            <p>The code and database powering this site are protected. Please don't scrape, clone, republish, or redistribute the underlying technology, data structure, or bulk content. This includes automated bots, mass downloads, or building a copycat site using our data.</p>

            <h2>3. Attribution (If You Want to Be Sound)</h2>
            <p>You don't have to, but if you share one of our insults somewhere, we'd love a nod back to ScottishInsults.com. It helps spread the word and keeps the insults flying.</p>

            <h2>4. Be Nice-ish</h2>
            <p>This site is for fun. Don't use it for harassment, bullying, or anything nasty. If you're going to insult someone, make sure it's in good humor and mutual fun.</p>

            <h2>5. No Warranty</h2>
            <p>We're not responsible if you get into a bar fight, lose a friend, or confuse a Glaswegian. Use the site at your own risk.</p>

            <h2>6. Use License</h2>
            <p>Permission is granted to temporarily use Scottish Insults for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:</p>
